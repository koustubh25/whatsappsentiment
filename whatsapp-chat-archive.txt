[2018/03/21 13:35:13] Koustubh: yeah, that's the plan. Well, Japan is good of course, but there are some issues like food, language etc.
[2018/03/21 13:35:45] Koustubh: I just feel like it's better to settle down in a English speaking country.

[2018/03/22 23:03:22] Koustubh: yes, Melbourne is in Australia. The weather is like Pune, not too cold, not too hot. But probably has lesser job opportunities than Sydney
[2018/03/22 23:03:31] Tanmayi: Oh shit v r so opposite

[2018/03/24 16:34:46] Koustubh: Ok
[2018/03/24 16:34:58] Koustubh: How about other kinds of sea food?
[2018/03/24 16:35:09] Koustubh: Like octopus or lobster?
[2018/03/24 16:35:23] Koustubh: Maybe not very common in India
[2018/03/24 16:36:13] Tanmayi: Yeah its not common that much
[2018/03/24 16:36:26] Koustubh: Actually the Japs eat lots of things which may sound crazy to Indians
[2018/03/24 16:36:37] Tanmayi: Ppl who live near to water bodies like in goa there it may be
[2018/03/24 16:36:41] Tanmayi: But not here
[2018/03/24 16:36:59] Koustubh: Did you know that they don’t even categorize their food as veg or non veg
[2018/03/24 16:37:00] Tanmayi: Yeah i know japenese eat weird creatures lol
[2018/03/24 16:37:15] Tanmayi: Hehehe acha kuch veg hota h nahi hoga wahan

[2018/03/24 16:41:17] Koustubh: Haan Indian friends
[2018/03/24 16:41:57] Koustubh: Actually mera opinion hain ke once you get a hang of Japanese food, you can enjoy it
[2018/03/24 16:42:08] Koustubh: It’s actually quite good and healthy
[2018/03/24 16:43:32] Tanmayi: Yeah i agree but typical ppl indians like me who r from especially north india delhi will be very uncomfortable
[2018/03/24 16:43:42] Tanmayi: Bcz v r almost half punjabis lol
[2018/03/24 16:43:50] Tanmayi: And need good masala food
[2018/03/24 16:44:34] Koustubh: I used to think that way before I got out of India, but trust there are so many things from different cultures you want to try
[2018/03/24 16:44:49] Koustubh: Btw, have you travelled outside India?
[2018/03/24 16:46:02] Tanmayi: Nope

[2018/03/24 17:54:29] Tanmayi: Neither pura summers neither pura winters
[2018/03/24 17:54:49] Koustubh: yeah, I think Melbourne should be colder

[2018/03/24 17:55:33] Koustubh: Sydney yes
[2018/03/24 17:55:38] Koustubh: not Melbourne I think
[2018/03/24 17:55:40] Tanmayi: Just googled the climate
[2018/03/24 17:55:57] Tanmayi: Lemme know bcz humid dono jagha hona chahiye i suppose

[2018/03/24 17:57:34] Tanmayi: Ok
[2018/03/24 17:58:35] Koustubh: I think this is a good comparison https://www.experienceoz.com.au/en/sydney-vs-melbourne
[2018/03/24 17:58:51] Koustubh: Don't care about the score, just read the content
[2018/03/24 18:04:41] Koustubh: Actually the temperatures in Melbourne are quite good http://www.holiday-weather.com/melbourne/averages/
[2018/03/24 18:04:54] Koustubh: Sydney I am pretty sure is hot and humid
[2018/03/24 18:06:26] Tanmayi: Yeah nice link
[2018/03/24 18:06:42] Tanmayi: Yeah i thnk melbourne is better
[2018/03/24 18:06:53] Tanmayi: But more rainy and more unpredictable
[2018/03/24 18:07:12] Koustubh: That's like London, you said you like London right?
[2018/03/24 18:07:19] Koustubh: :P
[2018/03/24 18:07:26] Tanmayi: And wo indians i thnk in terms of friendliness sydney is better lol
[2018/03/24 18:07:52] Tanmayi: Lol london is super cool with snowfall and chilly winters
[2018/03/24 18:09:54] Koustubh: There are many Indians in Melbourne as well, no problem
[2018/03/24 18:10:27] Koustubh: I meant the rainy part and the unpredictable weather
[2018/03/24 18:10:32] Tanmayi: Oh acha isi mai padha tha to bola
[2018/03/24 18:10:46] Tanmayi: Oh that i am not aware of
[2018/03/24 18:11:01] Tanmayi: And food is better than japenese food lol
[2018/03/24 18:11:21] Koustubh: I think you can find all kinds of food, should be much better than Japanese
[2018/03/24 18:17:54] Tanmayi: Yeah i also think so more indians are there
[2018/03/24 18:18:08] Tanmayi: So when r u shifting ?
[2018/03/24 18:18:29] Tanmayi: But i thnk japenese are better than Australians 🤔
[2018/03/24 18:18:40] Tanmayi: More kind and friendly
[2018/03/24 18:19:05] Koustubh: probably yes, but it's not real.
[2018/03/24 18:19:13] Koustubh: I mean they fake it.
[2018/03/24 18:19:55] Tanmayi: Oh acha y to apko h pata hoga
[2018/03/24 18:20:13] Tanmayi: So saraay frnds fir yahan indian h hai ya from other countries too?
[2018/03/24 18:20:41] Koustubh: So, I am expecting the visa in the next 1-2 months, after which I will take a long leave from my Japanese company and go to Australia to find a job. After that I plan to come back to Japan and settle things in Japan, like pension money and other things. So, overall my guess is the end of this year.
[2018/03/24 18:23:03] Koustubh: Japan mein mostly Japanese aur dusre countries se. Actually,  main jab yaha aya that, toh I didn't want to live with Indians because I thought what's the point, foreign aake Indians ke saath rehne mein. But last year 2016 mein maine ye company join ki jaha pe boht saare Indians hain. Isliye woh ab dost ban gaye hain
[2018/03/24 18:25:02] Tanmayi: Ohh nice .. when did u came here i mean japan ?
[2018/03/24 18:25:18] Koustubh: 2012
[2018/03/24 18:25:48] Tanmayi: Yeah atleast 8 months will be required to finally clean all this meas and settled down in australia
Where r u planning to settle down in Australia?
[2018/03/24 18:27:40] Koustubh: Actually, Sydney has more opportunities, but it is very hot and humid and very expensive. Melbourne is starting to get popular and people have started to move to Melbourne from Sydney. So, I am also thinking of Melbourne over Sydney
[2018/03/24 18:28:28] Koustubh: I don't know if you understand the analogy of Pune and Mumbai, but we say Pune is like Melbourne and Mumbai like Sydney
[2018/03/24 18:33:26] Tanmayi: Oh that i dnt understand actually 😐
I have been to mumbai and i really dnt like mumbai’s weather
Dnt know much about pune but have a perception that weather of both the places are pretty much same like humid and very sunny with cold breezes always
[2018/03/24 18:34:10] Koustubh: no no, Pune is not humid at all
[2018/03/24 18:35:19] Tanmayi: Oh acha
[2018/03/24 18:35:30] Tanmayi: So tell me more about urself
[2018/03/24 18:35:36] Tanmayi: What do u like and all
[2018/03/24 18:36:07] Koustubh: like food and stuff?
[2018/03/24 18:37:21] Tanmayi: Yeah i mean anything
[2018/03/24 18:39:08] Koustubh: well, I am actually quite low maintenance, I can eat anything. but, I am not very fond of sweets. I like spicy, but honestly can't eat very spicy things.
[2018/03/24 18:39:12] Koustubh: How about you?
[2018/03/24 18:40:32] Tanmayi: Lol
[2018/03/24 18:40:52] Tanmayi: What do u mean by low maintenance
[2018/03/24 18:41:25] Koustubh: I mean I am not very picky about things
[2018/03/24 18:41:34] Koustubh: I can adjust very easily
[2018/03/24 18:41:40] Tanmayi: I am also not choosy about food
Can eat anything and everything 
I like sweets
But try to avoid sweets , junk , oily foids
[2018/03/24 18:41:45] Tanmayi: Foods
[2018/03/24 18:42:06] Koustubh: ok, sounds good
[2018/03/24 18:42:28] Koustubh: and I hate shopping clothes, I like to shop electronics.

[2018/03/26 0:17:46] Koustubh: btw, I want to ask you a question. It's amazing that your parents are so liberal and the fact that you are talking to someone who is from a very different culture. Is it  normal in the north? Most of my north Indian friends wouldn't say it's normal.
[2018/03/26 0:17:28] Tanmayi: Hmmm
[2018/03/26 0:18:20] Koustubh: by normal, I mean common
[2018/03/26 0:19:48] Tanmayi: Lol i dnt know about others
But yes my family is very liberal
Many relatives and all in my family are from different states(in north but)
They are looking for a son in law and hus family who are nice kind ppl and can accept them and their daughter
[2018/03/26 0:19:54] Tanmayi: So yeah i mean y h hai
[2018/03/26 0:21:30] Koustubh: ok, nice
[2018/03/26 0:22:06] Koustubh: Are you religious?
[2018/03/26 0:22:05] Tanmayi: Hmmm
[2018/03/26 0:22:23] Tanmayi: Nope no at all
N u ?
[2018/03/26 0:22:43] Koustubh: not so much, but I can't say I am an athiest.
[2018/03/26 0:23:13] Tanmayi: I am may be
[2018/03/26 0:23:34] Tanmayi: Anyways but i am completely not ok with me eating non veg 😬
[2018/03/26 0:24:28] Tanmayi: And i can tolerate my partner .. eating any normal indian non veg with me 
But not pork and beef 🙁
[2018/03/26 0:24:47] Koustubh: Does it have anything to do with religion?
[2018/03/26 0:25:20] Koustubh: really? I am not a big fan of it, but I don't want to give it up.
[2018/03/26 0:25:20] Tanmayi: Noo

[2018/03/26 0:43:17] Koustubh: no questions, but I kind of want to mention that I am slightly socially awkward, but I am working on it. It just means sometimes I feel uncomfortable if there are like too many people.
